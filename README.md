# Youth_Project_CPSC471

A project inspired by the disorganization of my brother's group home. Group homes have many professionals involved but the application allows for three professionals 
to share data involving a youth at risk. The user types are: youth worker, psychologist, and pediatrician. Each user type is able to create a "document" which involves
inputting data into the the HTML form. Every time a document is created, a share code is generated and the user is able to share their document with another user. Each
document is data viewed within an HTML table. We designed the database using an Extended Entity-Relationship Model (EERD) and Relational Model (RM). The application was 
implemented with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JSON, and MySQL. The application has a REST API that uses JSON which is a similar format to a Python dictionary.
